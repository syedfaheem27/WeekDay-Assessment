# Weekday Minimalist Clone

A minimalist clone of the weekday website which displays the company data which is sent by the backend.

## Features

1. Infinite Load : Load more data as you scroll down> Achieved with the help of Intersection Observer.

2. Filter the companies based on Roles, Experience required, Minimum Base Salary, Location and the company name.

3. It uses redux to efficiently distribute the component wide state

4. A modal that shows all the company details when clicked on a company card. The Nodal has been built using the **Compound Component Pattern** which helps us to create a flexible interface to work with thus avoiding prop explosion.
